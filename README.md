This project was part of the The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

It's completely based on objects. I applied functions, arrays and object oriented programming. 

Besides that, I learned how to use geolocation and I reinforced my knowledge on using 3rd party libraries.

But the most important thing I learned was how to plan a project.
